<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF "DELIGHTED," AS SOMETIMES USED BY
SHAKSPEARE.</h3>
<p>I wish to call attention to the peculiar use of a word, or
rather to a peculiar word, in Shakspeare, which I do not recollect
to have met with in any other writer. I say a "peculiar word,"
because, although the verb <i>To delight</i> is well known, and of
general use, the word, the same in form, to which I refer, is not
only of different meaning, but, as I conceive, of distinct
derivation the non-recognition of which has led to a misconception
of the meaning of one of the finest passages in Shakspeare. The
first passage in which it occurs, that I shall quote, is the well
known one from <i>Measure for Measure</i>:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;</p>
<p>To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot,</p>
<p>This sensible warm motion to become</p>
<p>A kneaded clod; and the <i>delighted</i> spirit</p>
<p>To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside</p>
<p>In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice;</p>
<p>To be imprison'd in the viewless winds</p>
<p>And blown with restless violence round about</p>
<p>The pendant world." Act iii. Sc. 1.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, if we examine the construction of this passage, we shall
find that it appears to have been the object of the writer to
separate, and place in juxtaposition with each other, the
conditions of the body and the spirit, each being imagined under
circumstances to excite repulsion or terror in a sentient being.
The mind sees the former lying in "cold obstruction," rotting,
changed from a "sensible warm motion" to a "kneaded clod," every
circumstance leaving the impression of dull, dead weight, deprived
of force and motion. The spirit, on the other hand, is imagined
under circumstances that give the most vivid picture conceivable of
utter powerlessness:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Imprison'd in the viewless winds,</p>
<p>And blown with restless violence round about</p>
<p>The pendant world."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>To call the spirit here "delighted," in our sense of the term,
would be absurd; and no explanation of the passage in this sense,
however ingenious, is intelligible. That it is intended to
represent the spirit simply as <i>lightened</i>, made light,
relieved from the weight of matter, I am convinced, and this is my
view of the meaning of the word in the present instance.</p>
<p><i>Delight</i> is naturally formed by the participle <i>de</i>
and <i>light</i>, to make light, in the same way as "debase," to
make base, "defile," to make foul. The analogy is not quite so
perfect in such words as "define," "defile" (file), "deliver,"
"depart," &amp;c.; yet they all may be considered of the same
class. The last of these is used with us only in the sense of <i>to
go away</i>; in Shakspeare's time (and Shakspeare so uses it) it
meant also <i>to part</i>, or <i>part with</i>. A correspondent of
Mr. Knight's suggests <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id=
"page114"></a>{114}</span> for the word <i>delight</i> in this
passage, also, a new derivation; using <i>de</i> as a negation, and
<i>light (lux), delighted</i>, removed from the regions of light.
This is impossible; if we look at the context we shall see that it
not only contemplated no such thing, but that it is distinctly
opposed to it.</p>
<p>I am less inclined to entertain any doubt of the view I have
taken being correct, from the confirmation it receives in another
passage of Shakspeare, which runs as follows:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If virtue no <i>delighted</i> beauty lack,</p>
<p>Your son-in-law shows far more fair than black."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>Othello</i>, Act i. Sc. 3.</p>
<p>Passing by the cool impertinence of one editor, who asserts that
Shakspeare frequently used the past for the present participle, and
the almost equally cool correction of another, who places the
explanatory note "*delightful" at the bottom of the page, I will
merely remark that the two latest editors of Shakspeare, having
apparently nothing to say on the subject, have very wisely said
nothing. Yet, as we understand the term "delighted," the passage
surely needs explanation. We cannot suppose that Shakspeare used
epithets so weakening as "delighting" or "delightful." The meaning
of the passage would appear to be this: If virtue be not wanting in
beauty&mdash;such beauty as can belong to virtue, not physical, but
of a higher kind, and freed from all material elements&mdash;then
your son-in-law, black though he is, shows far more fair than
black, possessing, in fact, this <i>abstract</i> kind of beauty to
that degree that his colour is forgotten. In short, "delighted"
here seems to mean, <i>lightened</i> of all that is gross or
unessential.</p>
<p>There is yet another instance in Cymbeline, which seems to bear
a similar construction:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Whom best I love, I cross: to make my gifts</p>
<p>The more delay'd, <i>delighted</i>."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Act v. Sc. 4.</p>
<p>That is, "the <i>more</i> delighted;" the longer held back, the
better worth having; lightened of whatever might detract from their
value, that is, refined or purified. In making the remark here,
that "delighted" refers not to the recipient nor to the giver, but
to the gifts, I pass by the nonsense that the greatest master of
the English language did not heed the distinction between the past
and the present participles, as not worth a second thought.</p>
<p>The word appears to have had a distinct value of its own, and is
not to be explained by any other single word. If this be so, it
could hardly have been coined by Shakspeare. Though, possibly, it
may never have been much used, perhaps some of your correspondents
may be able to furnish other instances from other writers.</p>

<h3>AUTHORS OF "THE ROLLIAD."</h3>
<p>The subjoined list of the authors of <i>The Rolliad</i>, though
less complete than I could have wished, is, I believe,
substantially correct, and may, therefore, be acceptable to your
readers. The names were transcribed by me from a copy of the ninth
edition of <i>The Rolliad</i> (1791), still in the library at
Sunninghill Park, in which they had been recorded on the first page
of the respective papers.</p>
<p>There seems to be no doubt that they were originally
communicated by Mr. George Ellis, who has always been considered as
one of the most talented contributors to <i>The Rolliad</i>. He
also resided for many years at Sunninghill, and was in habits of
intimacy with the owners of the Park. Your correspondent C. (Vol.
ii., p. 43.) may remark that Lord John Townshend's name occurs only
twice in my list; but his Lordship may have written some of the
papers which are not in the Sunninghill volume, as they appeared
only in the editions of the work printed subsequently to 1791, and
are designated as <i>Political Miscellanies</i>.</p>

<p>I am not certain whether Mr. Adair, to whom "Margaret
Nicholson," one of the happiest of the Political Eclogues, is
attributed, is the present Sir Robert Adair. If so, as the only
survivor amongst his literary colleagues, he might furnish some
interesting particulars respecting the remarkable work to which I
have called your attention.</p>

<h3>DERIVATION OF EASTER.</h3>
<p>Southey, in his <i>Book of the Church</i>, derives our word
<i>Easter</i> from a <i>Saxon</i> source:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The worship," he says, "of the goddess <i>Eostre</i> or
<i>Eastre</i>, which may probably be traced to the Astarte of the
Phoenicians, is retained among us in the word <i>Easter</i>; her
annual festival having been superseded by that sacred day."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should he not rather have given a <i>British</i> origin to the
name of our Christian holy day? Southey acknowledges that the
"heathenism which the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id=
"page116"></a>{116}</span> Saxons introduced, bears no [very
little?] affinity either to that of the Britons or the Romans;" yet
it is certain that the Britons worshipped Baal and
<i>Ashtaroth</i>, a relic of whose worship appears to be still
retained in Cornwall to this day. The Druids, as Southey tells us,
"made the people pass through the fire in honour of Baal." But the
<i>festival</i> in honour of Baal appears to have been in the
<i>autumn</i>: for</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"They made the people," he informs us, "at the beginning of
<i>winter</i>, extinguish all their fires on one day and kindle
them again from the sacred fire of the Druids, which would make the
house fortunate for the ensuing year; and, if any man came who had
not paid his yearly dues, [Easter offerings, &amp;c., date back as
far as this!] they refused to give him a spark, neither durst any
of his neighbours relieve him, nor might he himself procure fire by
any other means, so that he and his family were deprived of it till
he had discharged the uttermost of his debt."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Druidical fires kindled in the <i>spring</i> of the year, on
the other hand, would appear to be those in honour of
<i>Ashtaroth</i>, or <i>Astarte</i>, from whom the <i>British
Christians</i> may naturally enough have derived the name of
<i>Easter</i> for their corresponding season. We might go even
further than this, and say that the young ladies who are reported
still to take the chief part in keeping up the Druidical
festivities in Cornwall, very happily represent the ancient
<i>Estal</i> (or <i>Vestal</i>) virgins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In times of Paganism," says O'Halloran, "we find in
<i>Ireland</i> females devoted to celibacy. There was in Tara a
royal foundation of this kind, wherein none were admitted but
virgins of the noblest blood. It was called Cluain-Feart, or the
place of retirement till death," &amp;c ... "The duty of these
virgins was to keep up the fires of Bel, or the sun, and of
Sambain, or the moon, which customs they borrowed from their
Phoenician ancestors. They both [<i>i.e.</i> the Irish and the
Phoenicians] adored Bel, or the sun, the moon, and the stars. The
'house of <i>Rimmon</i>' which the Phoenicians worshipped in, like
our temples of Fleachta in Meath, was sacred to the <i>moon</i>.
The word '<i>Rimmon</i>' has by no means been understood by the
different commentators; and yet, by recurring to the Irish (a
branch of the Phoenician) it becomes very intelligible; for
'<i>Re</i>' is Irish for the moon, and '<i>Muadh</i>' signifies an
<i>image</i>, and the compound word '<i>Reamhan</i>,' signifies
<i>prognosticating by the appearance of the moon</i>. It appears by
the life of our great S. Columba, that the Druid temples were here
decorated with figures of the sun, the moon, and stars. The
Phoenicians, under the name of <i>Bel-Samen</i>, adored the
Supreme; and it is pretty remarkable, that to this very day, to
wish a friend every happiness this life can afford, we say in
Irish, 'The blessings of <i>Samen</i> and <i>Bel</i> be with you!'
that is, of the seasons; Bel signifying the sun, and Samhain the
moon."</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>
<p><i>Presages of Death</i>.&mdash;The Note by Mr. C. FORBES (Vol.
ii., p. 84.) on "High Spirits considered a Presage of impending
Calamity or Death," reminded me of a collection of authorities I
once made, for academical purposes, of a somewhat analogous
bearing,&mdash;I mean the ancient belief in the existence of a
power of prophecy at that period which immediately precedes
dissolution.</p>
<p>The most ancient, as well as the most striking instance, is
recorded in the forty-ninth chapter of Genesis:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And Jacob called his sons and said, Gather yourselves together
<i>that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
days</i>.... And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons,
he gathered up his feet into his bed, and yielded up the ghost, and
was gathered unto his people."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Homer affords two instances of a similar kind: thus, Patroclus
prophesies the death of Hector (Il. [Greek: p] 852.)<a id=
"footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href=
"#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>[Greek: "Ou thaen oud autos daeron beae alla toi aedae</p>
<p>Agchi parestaeke Thanatos kai Moira krataiae,</p>
<p>Chersi dament Achilaeos amnmonos Aiakidao."]<a id="footnotetag2"
name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, Hector in his turn prophesies the death of Achilles by
the hand of Paris (Il. [Greek: ch.] 358.):&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>[Greek: "Phrazeo nun, mae toi ti theon maenima genomai</p>
<p>Aemati to ote ken se Pharis kai phoibus Apollon,</p>
<p>Esthlon eont, olesosin eni Skaiaesi pulaesin."]<a id=
"footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href=
"#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This was not merely a poetical fancy, or a superstitious faith
of the ignorant, for we find it laid down as a great physical truth
by the greatest of the Greek philosophers, the divine
Socrates:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "To de dae meta touto epithumo humin chraesmodaesai, o
katapsaephisamenoi mou kai gar eimi aedae entautha en o malist
anthropoi chraesmodousin hotan mellosin apothaneisthai."]<a id=
"footnotetag4" name="footnotetag4"></a><a href=
"#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Xenophon, also, the same idea is expressed, and, if possible,
in language still more definite and precise:&mdash;</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id=
"page117"></a>{117}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "Hae de tou anthropou psuchae tote daepou theiotatae
kataphainetai, kai tote ti ton mellonton proora."]<a id=
"footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href=
"#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Diodorus Siculus, again, has produced great authorities on this
subject:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "Puthagoras ho Samios, kai tines heteroi ton palaion
phusikon, apephaenanto tas psuchas ton anthropon uparchein
athanatous, akolouthos de to dogmati touto kai progignoskein autas
ta mellonta, kath hon an kairon en tae teleutae ton apo tou somatos
chorismon poiontai."]<a id="footnotetag6" name=
"footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the ancient writers I yet wish to add one more authority;
and I do so especially, because the doctrine of the Stagirite is
therein recorded. Sextus Empiricus writes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Greek: "Hae psuchae, phaesin Aristotelaes, promanteuetai kai
proagoreuei ta mellonta&mdash;en to kata thanaton chorizesthai ton
somaton."]<a id="footnotetag7" name="footnotetag7"></a><a href=
"#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without encroaching further upon the space of this periodical by
multiplying evidence corroborative of the same fact, I will content
myself by drawing the attention of the reader to our own great poet
and philosopher, Shakspeare, whose subtle genius and intuitive
knowledge of human nature render his opinions on all such subjects
of peculiar value. Thus in <i>Richard II</i>., Act ii. sc. 1., the
dying Gaunt, alluding to his nephew, the young and self-willed
king, exclaims,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Methinks I am a prophet new inspired;</p>
<p>And thus, expiring, do foretel of him."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, in <i>Henry IV., Part I.</i>, Act v. sc. 4., the brave
Percy, when in the agonies of death, conveys the same idea in the
following words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">"O, I could prophesy,</p>
<p>But that the earthy and cold hand of death</p>
<p>Lies on my tongue."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Reckoning, therefore, from the time of Jacob, this belief,
whether with or without foundation, has been maintained upwards of
3500 years. It was grounded on the assumed fact, that the soul
became divine in the same ratio as its connection with the body was
loosened or destroyed. In sleep, the unity is weakened but not
ended: hence, in sleep, the material being dead, the immaterial, or
divine principle, wanders unguided, like a gentle breeze over the
unconscious strings of an &AElig;olian harp; and according to the
health or disease of the body are pleasing visions or horrid
phantoms (<i>&aelig;gri somnia</i>, as Horace) present to the mind
of the sleeper. Before death, the soul, or immaterial principle,
is, as it were, on the confines of two worlds, and may possess at
the same moment a power which is both prospective and
retrospective. At that time its connection with the body being
merely nominal, it partakes of that perfectly pure, ethereal, and
exalted nature (<i>quod multo magis faciet post mortem quum omnino
corpore excesserit</i>) which is designed for it hereafter.</p>
<p>As the question is an interesting one, I conclude by asking,
through the medium of the "NOTES AND QUERIES," if a belief in this
power of prophesy before death be known to exist at the present
day?</p>

<p><i>Divination at Marriages</i>.&mdash;The following practices
are very prevalent at marriages in these districts; and as I do not
find them noticed by Brand in the last edition of his <i>Popular
Antiquities</i>, they may perhaps be thought worthy a place in the
"NOTES AND QUERIES."</p>
<p>1. Put a wedding ring into the <i>posset</i>, and after serving
it out, the unmarried person whose cup contains the ring will be
the first of the company to be married.</p>
<p>2. Make a common flat cake of flour, water, currants, &amp;c.,
and put therein a wedding ring and a sixpence. When the company is
about to retire on the wedding-day, the cake must be broken and
distributed amongst the unmarried females. She who gets the ring in
her portion of the cake will shortly be married, and the one who
gets the sixpence will die an old maid.</p>

<h3>FRANCIS LENTON THE POET.</h3>
<p>In a MS. obituary of the seventeenth century, preserved at
Staunton Hall, Leicestershire, I found the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"May 12. 1642. This day died Francis Lenton, of Lincoln's Inn,
Gent."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This entry undoubtedly relates to the author of three very rare
poetical tracts: 1. <i>The Young Gallant's Whirligigg</i>, 1629; 2.
<i>The Innes of Court</i>, 1634; 3. <i>Great Brittain's
Beauties</i>, 1638. In the dedication to Sir Julius C&aelig;sar,
prefixed to the first-named work, the writer speaks of having "once
belonged to the <i>Innes of Court</i>," and says he was "no usuall
poetizer, but, to barre idlenesse, imployed that little talent the
Muses conferr'd upon him in this little tract." Sir Egerton Brydges
supposed the copy of <i>The Young Gallant's Whirligigg</i>
preserved in the library of Sion College to be <i>unique</i>; but
this is not the case, as the writer knows of <i>two</i>
others,&mdash;one at Staunton Hall, and another at Tixall Priory in
Staffordshire. It has been reprinted by Mr. <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>{118}</span> Halliwell
at the end of a volume containing <i>The Marriage of Wit and
Wisdom</i>, published by the Shakspeare Society. In his prefatory
remarks that gentleman says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Besides his printed works, Lenton wrote the <i>Poetical History
of Queene Hester</i>, with the translation of the 83rd Psalm,
reflecting upon the present times. MS. dated 1649."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This date must be incorrect, if our entry in the Staunton
obituary relates to the same person; and there is every reason to
suppose that it does. The <i>autograph</i> MS. of Lenton occurred
in Heber's sale (Part xi. No. 724.), and is thus described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Hadassiah</i>, or the <i>History of Queen Hester</i>, sung in
a sacred and serious poeme, and divided into ten chapters, by F.
Lenton, the Queen's Majesties Poet, 1638.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is undoubtedly the <i>correct</i> date, as it is in the
handwriting of the author. Query. What is the meaning of Lenton's
title, "the Queen's Majesties Poet"?</p>
<p class="author">Edward F. Rimbault.</p>

<h3>Minor Notes.</h3>
<p><i>Lilburn or Prynne?</i>&mdash;I am anxious to suggest in
"Notes and Queries" whether a character in the Second Canto of Part
iii. of <i>Hudibras</i> (line 421), beginning,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"To match this saint, there was another,</p>
<p>As busy and perverse a brother,</p>
<p>An haberdasher of small wares,</p>
<p>In politics and state affairs,"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Has not been wrongly given by Dr. Grey to Lilburn, and whether
Prynne is not rather the person described. Dr. Grey admits in his
note that the application of the passage to Lilburn involves an
anachronism, Lilburn having died in 1657, and this passage being a
description of one among</p>

<p class="author">CH.</p>
<p><i>Peep of Day.</i>&mdash;Jacob Grimm, in his <i>Deutsche
Mythologie</i>, p. 428., ed. 1., remarks that the ideas of light
and sound are sometimes confounded; and in support of his
observation he quotes passages of Danish and German poets in which
the sun and moon are said to <i>pipe</i> (pfeifen). In further
illustration of this usage, he also cites the words "the sun began
to peep," from a Scotch ballad in Scott's <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>,
vol. ii. p. 430. In p. 431. he explains the words "par son l'aube,"
which occur in old French poets, by "per sonitum auror&aelig;;" and
compares the English expression, "the peep of day."</p>
<p>The Latin <i>pipio</i> or <i>pipo</i>, whence the Italian
<i>pipare</i>, and the French <i>p&eacute;pier</i>, is the ultimate
origin of the verb <i>to peep</i>; which, in old English, bore the
sense of chirping, and is so used in the authorised version of
Isaiah, viii. 19., x. 14. Halliwell, in his <i>Archaic
Dictionary</i>, explains "peep" as "a flock of chickens," but cites
no example. <i>To peep</i>, however, in the sense of taking a rapid
look at anything through a small aperture, is an old use of the
word, as is proved by the expression <i>Peeping</i> Tom of
Coventry. As so used, it corresponds with the German <i>gucken</i>.
Mr. Richardson remarks that this meaning was probably suggested by
the young chick looking out of the half-broken shell. It is quite
certain that the "peep of day" has nothing to do with sound; but
expresses the first appearance of the sun, as he just looks over
the eastern hills.</p>
<p class="author">L.</p>
<p><i>Martinet.</i>&mdash;Will the following passage throw any
light on the origin of the word <i>Martinet</i>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Une discipline, devenue encore plus exacte, avait mis dans
l'arm&eacute;e un nouvel ordre. Il n'y avait point encore
d'inspecteurs de cavalerie et d'infanterie, comme nous en avons vu
depuis, mais deux hommes uniques chacun dans leur genre en fesaient
les fonctions. <i>Martinet mettait alors l'infanterie sur le pied
de discipline o&ugrave; elle est aujourd'hui.</i> Le Chevalier de
<i>Fourilles</i> fesait la m&ecirc;me change dans la cavalerie. Il
y avait un an que <i>Martinet</i> avait mis la baionnette en usage

<p><i>Guy's Porridge Pot.</i>&mdash;In the porter's lodge at
Warwick Castle are preserved some enormous pieces of armour, which,
<i>according to tradition</i>, were worn by the famous champion
"Guy, Earl of Warwick;" and in addition (with other marvellous
curiosities) is also exhibited Guy's porridge pot, of bell metal,
said to weigh 300 lbs., and to contain 120 gallons. There is also a
flesh-fork to ring it.</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols, in his <i>History of Leicestershire</i>, Part ii.
vol. iii., remarks,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A turnpike road from Ashby to Whitwick, passes through Talbot
Lane. Of this lane and the famous large pot at Warwick Castle, we
have an old traditionary couplet:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"'There's nothing left of Talbot's name,</p>
<p>But Talbot's Pot and Talbot's Lane.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Richard Beauchamp Earl of Warwick, died in 1439. His eldest
daughter, Margaret, was married to John Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury,
by whom she had one son, John Viscount Lisle, from whom the Dudleys
descended, Viscount Lisle and Earl of Warwick."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would therefore appear that neither the armour nor the pot
belonged to the "noble Guy"&mdash;the armour being comparatively of
modern manufacture, and the pot, it appears, descended from the
Talbots to the Warwick family: which pot is generally filled with
punch on the birth of a male heir to that noble family.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>
<h3>NICHOLAS FERRAR OF LITTLE GIDDING.</h3>
<p>Dr. Peckard, in his Preface to the <i>Life of Nicholas Ferrar of
Little Gidding</i>, says the memoir he published was edited or
compiled by him from "the original MS. still in my possession" (p.
xi.); and in the Appendix adds, that "Mr. John Ferrar," the elder
brother of Nicholas, was the author of it (p. 279.).</p>
<p>How he compiled or edited "the original MS." he states with much
candour in his Preface (p. xv.):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The editor's intention," in altering the narrative, "was to
give what is not observed in the original, a regular series of
facts; and through the whole a sort of evenness and simplicity of
stile equally free from meanness and affectation. In short, to make
the old and the new, as far as he could, uniform; that he might not
appear to have sewed a piece of new cloth to an old garment, and
made its condition worse by his endeavours to mend it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, at page 308., he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There is an antient MS. in folio, giving an account of Mr. N.
Ferrar, which at length, from Gidding, came into the hands of Mr.
Ed. Ferrar of Huntingdon, and is now in the possession of the
editor. Mr. Peck had the use of this MS. as appears by several
marginal notes in his handwriting; from this and some loose and
unconnected papers of Mr. Peck.... the editor, as well as he was
able, has made out the foregoing memoirs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can any of your numerous correspondents inform me if this
"antient MS." is still in existence, and in whose possession?</p>
<p>Peckard was related to the Ferrars, and was Master of Magdalen
Coll., Cambridge.</p>
<p>In "A Catalogue of MSS. (once) at Gidding," Peckard, p. 306.,
the third article is "Lives, Characters, Histories, and Tales for
moral and religious Instruction, in five volumes folio, neatly
bound and gilt, by Mary Collet." This work, with five others,
"undoubtedly were all written by N. Ferrar, Sen.," says Dr.
Peckard; and in the Memoir, at page 191., he gives a list of these
"short histories," ninety-eight in number, "which are still
remaining in my possession;" and adds further, at p. 194.,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"These lives, characters, and moral essays would, I think, fill
two or three volumes in 8vo., but <i>they are written in so
minute</i> a character, that I cannot form any conjecture to be
depended upon."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been thus particular in describing these "histories",
because the subjects of them are identical with those in Fuller's
<i>Holy and Profane State</i>, the first edition of which was
published at Cambridge, in 1642. "The characters I have conformed,"
says Fuller in his Preface, "to the then standing laws of the realm
(a twelvemonth ago were they sent to the press), since which time
the wisdom of the King and state hath" altered many things.
Nicholas Ferrar died December 2, 1637, and the Query I wish to ask
is, Did Fuller compose them (for that he was really the author of
them can hardly be doubted) at the suggestion and for the benefit
of the community at Gidding, some years before he published them;
and is it possible to ascertain and determine if the MS. is in the
handwriting of Ferrar or Fuller?</p>
<p>Is there any print or view in existence of the "Nunnery," at
Little Gidding?</p>
<p>In the <i>Life of Dr. Thomas Fuller</i>, published anonymously
in 1661, it is stated, that at his funeral a customary sermon was
preached by Dr. Hardy, Dean of Rochester, "which hath not yet
(though it is hoped and much desired may) passe the presse," p.
63.</p>
<p>Query. Was this sermon ever published? and secondly, who was the
author of the <i>Life</i> from which the above passage is
quoted?</p>

<h3>STUKELEY'S "STONEHENGE."</h3>
<p>May I request a space in your periodical for the following
Queries, drawn from Dr. Stukeley's <i>Stonehenge and Abury</i>, p.
31.?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1st. "But eternally to be lamented is the loss of that tablet of
tin, which was found at this place (Stonehenge) in the time of King
Henry VIII., inscribed with many letters, but in so strange a
character that neither Sir Thomas Elliott, a learned antiquary, nor
Mr. Lilly, master of St. Paul's school, could make any thing out of
it. Mr. Sammes may be right, who judges it to have been
<i>Punic</i>. I imagine if we call it Irish we shall not err much.
No doubt but what it was a memorial of the founders, wrote by the
Druids and had it been preserved till now, would have been an
invaluable curiosity."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you or any of your contributors give me any further
information about this inscription?</p>
<p>2. The Doctor continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To make the reader some amends for such a loss I have given a
specimen of supposed Druid writing, out of Lambecius' account of
the Emperor's library at Vienna. 'Tis wrote on a very thin plate of
gold with a sharp-pointed instrument. It was in an urn found at
Vienna, rolled up in several cases of other metal, together with
funeral exuvi&aelig;. It was thought by the curious, one of those
epistles which the Celtic people were wont to send to their friends
in the other world. The reader may divert himself with trying to
explain it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has this inscription ever been explained, and how? Stukeley's
book is by no means a rare one; therefore I have not trusted myself
to copy the inscription: and such as feel disposed to help me in my
difficulty would doubtless prefer seeing the Doctor's own
illustration at p. 31.</p>

<h3>ATHELSTANE'S FORM OF DONATION.&mdash;MEANING OF "SOMAGIA."</h3>
<p>Tristram Risdon, in his quaint <i>Survey of the Co. of
Devon</i>, after mentioning the foundation of the church of High
Bickington by King Athelstane,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Who," he says, "gave to God and it one hide of land, as
appeareth by the donation, a copy whereof, for the antiquity
thereof, I will here insert: 'Iche Athelstane king, grome of this
home, geve and graunt to the preist of this chirch, one yoke of mye
land frelith to holde, woode in my holt house to buyld, bitt grass
for all hys beasts, fuel for hys hearth, pannage for hys sowe and
piggs, world without end,'"&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>adds presently afterwards, that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sir John Willington gave <i>Weeksland</i> in this tything, unto
Robert Tolla, <i>cum 40 somagia annuatim capiend in Buckenholt</i>
(so be the words of the grant) in the time of K. Edw. I."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Willingtons were lords of the manor of Umberleigh, where
Athelstane's palace stood, with its chapel dedicated to the Holy
Trinity, formerly rich in ancient monuments, and having a chantry
near to it. Some of the monuments from this chapel are still
preserved in the neighbouring church of Atherington.</p>
<p>My Queries upon this Note are:</p>
<p>1. Whence did Risdon derive his copy of King Athelstane's form
of donation? 2. What is the precise meaning of the word
<i>Somagia</i>?</p>
<p>In <i>Ducange</i> (ed. Par. 1726, tom. vi. col. 589.) I
find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Somegia</i>. Pr&aelig;statio, ut videtur <i>ex summis</i>,
v. gr. bladi, frumenti. Charta Philippi Reg. Franc. an. 1210. Idem
etiam Savaricus detinet sibi census suos, et venditiones, et
quosdam reditus, qui <i>Somegi&aelig;</i> vocantur, et avenam, et
<i>captagia</i> hominum et foeminarum suarum, qui reditus cum una

</blockquote>
<p>Ducange refers also to some kindred words; but, instead of
clearing up my difficulty in the word <i>somagia</i>, he presents
me with another in <i>captagia</i>, the meaning of which I do not
clearly understand. Perhaps some of your more learned contributors

<h3>ULRICH VON HUTTEN AND THE "EPISTOL&AElig; OBSCURORUM
VIRONUM."</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 55.)</h4>
<p>I have never seen the article in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> to
which your correspondent H.B.C. alludes: he will probably find it
by reference to the index, which is not just now within my reach.
The neat London edition, 1710, of the <i>Epistol&aelig;</i> was
given by Michael Mattaire. There are several subsequent
reimpressions, but none worth notice except that by Henr. Guil.
Rotermund, Hanover, 1827, 8vo.; and again, with improvements, "cum
nova pr&aelig;fatione, nec non illustratione historica circa
originem earum, atque notitia de vita et scriptis virorum in
Epistolis occurentium aucta," 1830, both in 8vo.</p>
<p>The best edition, however, is that given by Dr. Ernst
M&uuml;nch, Leipsic, 1827, 8vo., with the following title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Epistol&aelig; Obscurorum Virorum aliaque &AElig;vi Decimi
sexti Monimenta Rarissima. Die Briefe der Finsterlinge an Magister
Ortuinus von Deventer, nebst andern sehr seltenen Beitr&auml;gen
zur Literatur-Sitten-und-Kirchengeschichte des xvi'n
Jahrhunderts."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This contains many important additions, and a copious historical
introduction. Both the editors write in German.</p>
<p>That this admirable satire produced an immense effect at the
period of its publication, there can be no doubt; but that it has
ever been thoroughly understood and relished among us may be
doubted. Mr. Hallam, in his <i>Literature of Europe</i>, vol. i.,
seems to have been disgusted with the monkish dog-Latin and bald
jokes, not recollecting that this was a necessary and essential
part of the design. Nor is it strange that Steele, who was perhaps
not very well acquainted with the history of literature, should
have misconceived the nature of the publication, when we learn from
an epistle of Sir Thomas More to Erasmus, that some of the stupid
theologasters themselves, who were held up to ridicule, received it
with approbation as a serious work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>Epist. Obs. Viror</i>. oper&aelig; pretium est videre
quantopere placeant omnibus, et doctis joco, et indoctis serio, qui
dum ridemus, putant rideri stylum tantum, quem illi non defendunt,
sed gravitate sententiarum dicunt compensatum, et latere sub rudi
vagina pulcherrimum gladium. Utinam fuisset inditus libello alius
titulus! Profecto intra centum annos homines studio stupidi non
sensissent nasum, quamquam rhinocerotico longiorem."<a id=
"footnotetag8" name="footnotetag8"></a><a href=
"#footnote8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Erasmus evidently enjoyed the witty contrivance, though he
affects to disapprove it as an anonymous libel. Simler, in his life
of Bullinger, relates that on the first reading Erasmus fell into
such a fit of laughter as to burst an abscess in his face with
which he was at that time troubled, and which prevented the
necessity of a surgical operation.</p>
<p>The literary history of the <i>Epistol&aelig;</i> and the
<i>Dialogue</i> is involved in obscurity. That Ulrich von Hutten
had a large share in their concoction there can be no doubt; and
that he was assisted by Crotus Rubianus and Hermann von Busch, if
not by others, seems highly probable. The authorship of
<i>Lamentationes Obscurorum Virorum</i> is a paradox which has not
yet been solved. They are a parody, but a poor one, of the
<i>Epistol&aelig;</i>, and in the second edition are attributed to
Ortuinus Gratius. If they are by him, he must have been a dull dog
indeed; but by some it has been thought that they are the work of a
Reuchlinist, to mystify the monks of Cologne, and render them still
more ridiculous; yet, as the Pope's bull against the
<i>Epistol&aelig;</i>, and Erasmus's disapproving letter, find a
prominent place, and some other well-grounded inculpations occur,
it appears to me that some slender-witted advocate of the enemies
of learning has here shown his want of skill in handling the
weapons of the adversary.</p>
<p>How much Sir Thomas More was pleased with the writings of Hutten
we may gather from the opening of a letter which Erasmus addressed
to Hutten, giving an interesting account of his illustrious friend,
in August, 1519:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Quod Thom&aelig; Mori ingenium sic deamas, ac pen&egrave;
dixerim deperis, nimirum scriptis illius inflammatus, quibus (ut
ver&egrave; scribis) nihil esse potest neque doctius neque
festivius; istue mibi crede, clarissime Huttene tibi cum multis
commune est, cum Moro mutuum etiam. Nam is vicissim ade&ograve;
scriptorum tuorum genio delectatur, ut ipse tibi plopemodum
invideam."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dialogue (Mire Festivus), which in the edition of 1710
occurs between the first and second parts of the
<i>Epistol&aelig;</i>, bears especial marks of Hutten's manner, and
is doubtless by him. The interlocutors are three of the illustrious
obscure, Magisters Ortuinus, Lupoldus, and Gingolphus, and the
first act of the comedy consists in their observations upon the
promoters of learning, Reuchlin, Erasmus, and Faber Stapulensis,
who afterwards make their appearance, and the discussion becomes
general, but no impression can be made upon the stupid and
prejudiced monks. The theme is, of course, the inutility of the new
learning, Hebrew and Greek and correct Latinity. One short passage
seems to me admirable:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id=
"page122"></a>{122}</span>
<blockquote>
<p>"<i>M. Ging</i>. Et Sanctus Ambrosius, Sanctus Augustinus, et
alii omnes zelossimi doctores non sciebant ipsi bene tot, sicut
iste Ribaldi? <i>M. Ort</i>. Ipsi deberent interponere suis. <i>M.
Lup</i>. Non bene indigemus de suo Gr&aelig;co. <i>M. Ging</i>.
Videtur eis, qui sciunt dicere <i>tou, tou, logos, monsotiros,
legoim, taff, hagiotatos</i>, quod ipse sciunt plus quam Deus.
<i>M. Ort</i>. Magister noster Lupolde, creditis, quod Deus curat
multum de iste Gr&aelig;co? <i>M. Lup</i>. Certe non, Magister
noster Ortuine, ego credo, quod Deus non curat multum."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ranke, in his <i>History of the Reformation</i>, has very justly
estimated the merits and character of these remarkable
productions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We must not look for the delicate apprehension and tact, which
can only be formed in a highly polished state of society, nor for
the indignation of insulted morality expressed by the ancients: it
is altogether a caricature, not of finished individual portraits,
but of a single type;&mdash;a clownish sensual German priest, his
intellect narrowed by stupid wonder and fanatical hatred, who
relates with silly <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and gossiping
confidence the various absurd and scandalous situations into which
he falls. These letters are not the work of a high poetical genius,
but they have truth, coarse strong features of resemblance, and
vivid colouring."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ranke mentions another satire, which appeared in March, 1520,
directed against John Eck, the opponent of Luther, the latter being
regarded in the light of a successor of Reuchlin, under the title
of <i>Abgehobelte Eck</i>, or <i>Eccius dedolatus</i>, "which, for
fantastic invention, striking and crushing truth, and Aristophanic
wit, far exceeded the <i>Liter&aelig; Obsc. V.</i>, which it
somewhat resembled." I have not yet been able to meet with this;
but such high praise, from so judicious a critic, makes me very
desirous to see and peruse it.</p>

containing much of the information required. It is worthy of
remark, that in page 195. we are told</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In 1710 there was printed in London the <i>most elegant</i>
edition that has ever appeared of these letters, which the editor,
Mich. Mattaire, gravely represents as the productions of their

</blockquote>
<p>Now this edition, though neat, has no claim to be termed most
elegant, which is hardly to be reconciled with what the reviewer
says in a note, p. 210., "that the text of this ed. of 1710 is of
no authority, and swarms with typographical blunders."</p>
<p>The work on its first appearance produced great excitement, and
was condemned by Pope Leo X. See <i>Dict. des Livres

<h3>CAXTON'S PRINTING-OFFICE.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., p. 99.)</h4>
<p>Mr. Rimbault is wrong in giving to Abbot Milling the honour of
being the patron of Caxton, which is due to Abbot Esteney. Mr. C.
Knight in his <i>Life of Caxton</i>, which appropriately formed the
first work of his series of <i>Weekly Volumes</i>, has the
following remarks upon the passage from Stow, quoted by Mr.
Rimbault:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The careful historians of London here committed one error; John
Islip did not become abbot of Westminster till 1500. John Esteney
was made abbot in 1474, and remained such until his death in 1498.
His predecessor was Thomas Milling. In Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>
we find, speaking of Esteney, 'It was in this abbot's time, and not
in that of Milling, or in that of Abbot Islip, that Caxton
exercised the art of printing at Westminster.'"&mdash;p. 140.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no work at hand to which I can refer for the date of
Milling's death, but if 1492 be correct, perhaps he may have been
promoted to a bishoprick.</p>
<p>With reference to Mr. Rimbault's remark, that Caxton first
mentions the place of his printing in 1477, so that he must have
printed some time without informing us where, I may be allowed to
observe that it seems highly probable he printed, and indeed
learned the art, at Cologne. At the end of the third book of his
translation of the <i>Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye</i>,
Caxton says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Thus end I this book which I have translated after mine author,
as nigh as God hath given me cunning, to whom be given the laud and
praises ... I have practised and learned, at my great charge and
dispense, to ordain this said book in print, after the manner and
form as you may here see."</p>
</blockquote>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id=
"page123"></a>{123}</span>
<p>And on the title-page he informs us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Whyche sayd translacion and werke was begonne in Brugis in
1468, and ended in the holy cyte of Colen, 19 Sept. 1471."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may refer to the translation only; but as Caxton was both
translator and printer, it does not seem unreasonable to regard it
as indicating when his entire labour upon the work was brought to a
close. I might support the view that Caxton printed at Cologne by
other arguments which would make the matter tolerably certain (see
<i>Life of Caxton</i>, p. 125., &amp;c.); but as the excellent
little work to which I am indebted for these particulars is so well
known, and so easily accessible, I should not be justified in
occupying more of your space, and I will therefore conclude with
noting that the parochial library at Shipdham, in Norfolk, is said
to contain books printed by Caxton and other early printers.
Perhaps some one of your correspondents would record, for the
general benefit, of what they consist.</p>
<p class="author">Arun.</p>
<p>Dr. Rimbault has evidently not seen a short article on Caxton's
printing at Westminster, which I inserted in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> for April, 1846, nor the reference made to it in the
magazine for June last, p. 630., or he would have admitted that his
objections to Dr. Dibdin's conjectures on this point had been
already stated; moreover, I think he would have seen that the
difficulty had been actually cleared up. In truth, the popular
misapprehension on this subject has not been occasioned by any
obscurity in the colophons of the great printer, or in the survey
of Stow, but merely by the erroneous constricted sense into which
the word abbey has passed in this country. Caxton himself tells us
he printed his books in "th' abbay of Westminstre," but he does not
say in the church of the abbey. Stow distinctly says it was in the
almonry of the abbey; and the handbill Dr. Rimbault refers to
confirms that fact. The almonry was not merely "within the
precincts of the abbey," it was actually a part of the abbey. Dr.
Rimbault aims at the conclusion that "the old chapel of St. Anne
was doubtless the place where the first printing-office was erected
in England." But why so? Did not the chapel continue a chapel until
the Reformation, if not later? And Caxton would no more set up his
press in a chapel than in the abbey-church itself. Stow says it was
erected in the almonry. The almonry was one of the courts of the
abbey, (situated directly west of the abbey-church, and not east,
as Dr. Dibdin surmised); it contained a chapel dedicated to St.
Anne, and latterly an almshouse erected by the Lady Margaret. The
latter probably replaced other offices or lodgings of greater
antiquity, connected with the duties of the almoner, or the
reception and relief of the poor; and there need be no doubt that
it was one of these buildings that the Abbot of Westminster placed
at the disposal of our proto-typographer. There was nothing very
extraordinary in his so doing if we view the circumstance in its
true light; for the <i>scriptoria</i> of the monasteries had ever
been the principal manufactories of books. A single press was now
to do the work of many pens. The experiment was successful; "after
which time," as Stow goes on to say, "the like was practised in the
Abbeys of St. Augustine, at Canterbury, St. Alban's, and other
monasteries." The monks became printers instead of scribes; but
they would not ordinarily convert their churches or chapels into
printing-houses. The workmen, it is true, term the meetings held
for consultation on their common interests or pleasures, their
<i>chapels</i>; and whether this may have arisen from any
particular instance in which a chapel was converted into a
printing-house, I cannot say. In order to ascertain the origin of
this term these Queries may be proposed:&mdash;Is it peculiar to
printers and to this country? Or is it used also in other trades
and on the Continent?</p>

<p>Although I am unable to give a satisfactory reply to Mr. Foss's
inquiries, such information as I have is freely at his service. It
may, at all events, serve as a finger-post to the road.</p>
<p>My survey gives a most minute extent, of 35 preceptories, 23
"camer&aelig;" of the Hospitallers, 13 preceptories formerly
commandries of the Templars, 74 limbs, and 70 granges,
impropriations, &amp;c., and, among them all, not a single one of
the valuation of the New Temple itself. <i>Reprises</i> of that
establishment are entered, but no <i>receipts</i>.</p>
<p>The former are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In emendationem et sustentationem ecclesie Novi Templi, London,
et in vino, cera, et oleo, et ornamentis ejusdem ... x m.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Magnatibus, secretariis, et familiaribus domini Regis et

</blockquote>
<p>the pensions enumerated amount to about 440<i>l.</i> per
annum.</p>
<p>Then, to the treasurer, barons, clerks, &amp;c., of the
Exchequer (140 persons):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Bis in anno, videlicet, tempore yemali, pilliola furrata

<p>"Item in donis dandis in Curiis domini Regis et aliorum magnatum
<i>pro favore habendo</i> et pro placitis defendendis, et expensis

</blockquote>
<p>I have made these extracts somewhat more at length than may,
perhaps, be to the point in question, because they contain much
that is highly interesting as to the apparently questionable mode
in which the Hospitallers obtained the protection of the courts
(and probably they were not singular in their proceedings); annual
pensions to judges, besides other largesses, and much of this "pro
favore habendo," contrasts painfully with the "spotless purity of
the ermine" which dignifies our present age.</p>
<p>In the "extent" we have occasionally a grange held rent free for
life by a judge. Chief Justice Geffrey de Scrop so held that of
Penhull in Northumberland.</p>
<p>Putting all these facts together, and bearing in mind that,
throughout this elaborate "extent," there are neither profits nor
rent entered, as for the Temple itself, so that it seems to have
then been neither in the possession nor occupation of the
Hospitallers, is it not possible that they had alienated it to the
lawyers, as a discharge for these heavy annual
incumbrances,&mdash;<i>prospectively</i>, perhaps, because by the
entry of these charges among the "reprise," the life interests, at
all events, were still paid; or perhaps the alienation was itself
made to them "pro favore habendo" in some transaction that the
Hospitallers wished to have carried by the Courts; or it may have
been made as a <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> bribe for future protection.
At all events, when we see such extensive payments made annually to
the lawyers, their ultimate possession of the fee simple is no
unnatural result. But, as I am altogether ignorant of the history
of the New Temple, I must refrain from suggestions, giving the
simple facts as I find them, and leaving the rest to the learning
and investigation of your correspondent.</p>

<h3>STRANGERS IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.</h3>
<h4>(Vol. ii., pp. 17. 83.)</h4>
<p>Mr. Ross is right in saying that "no alteration has taken place
in the <i>practice</i> of the House of Commons with respect to the
admission of strangers." The practice was at variance with the old
sessional order: it is consistent with the new standing order of
1845. I do not understand how any one can read these words of the
new standing order, "that the sergeant-at-arms ... do take into his
custody any stranger whom he may see ... in any part of the house
or gallery appropriated to the members of the House: and also any
stranger <i>who, having been admitted into any other part of the
house or gallery</i>," &amp;c., and say that the House of Commons
does not now recognise the presence of strangers; nor can I
understand how Mr. Ross can doubt that the old sessional order
absolutely prohibited their presence. It did not keep them out
certainly, for they were admitted in the teeth of it; but so long
as that sessional order was in force, prohibition to strangers was
the theory.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross refers to publication of speeches. Publication is still
prohibited in theory. Mr. Ross perhaps is not aware that the
prohibition of publication of speeches rests on a foundation
independent of the old sessional order against the presence of
strangers,&mdash;on a series of resolutions declaring publication
to be a breach of the privileges of Parliament, to be found in the
Journals of 1642, 1694, 1695, 1697, 1703, 1722, and 1724.</p>
<p>We unfortunately cannot settle in your columns whether, as Mr.
Ross asserts, "if a member in debate should inadvertently allude to
the possibility of his observations being heard by a stranger, the
Speaker would immediately call him to order;" but my strong belief
is, that he would not: and I hope, if there are any members of the
House of Commons who have time to read "Notes and Queries," that
one of them may be induced to take a suitable opportunity of
obtaining the Speaker's judgment.</p>
<p>"Yet at other times," Mr. Ross goes on to say, "the right
honourable gentlemen will listen complacently to discussions
arising out of the complaints of members that strangers will not
publish to the world all that they hear pass in debate." If this be
so, I suppose the Speaker sees nothing disorderly in a complaint,
that what has been spoken in Parliament has <i>not</i> been
published: but I read frequently in my newspaper that the Speaker
interrupts <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
"page125"></a>{125}</span> members who speak of speeches having
been published. "This is one of the inconsistencies," Mr. Ross
proceeds, "resulting from the determination of the House not
expressly to recognise the presence of strangers." Inconsistency
there certainly is,&mdash;the inconsistency of making publication a
breach of privilege, and allowing it to go on daily.</p>
<p>As strangers may be admitted into the House to hear debates, and
not allowed to publish what they hear, so they may he admitted,
subject to exclusion at certain times, or when the House chooses.
And this is the case. The House, of course, retains the power of
excluding them at any moment. They are always made to withdraw
before the House goes to a division. This is a matter of practice,
founded probably on some supposed reasons of convenience. Again, on
any member desiring strangers to be excluded, the Speaker desires
them to withdraw, without allowing any discussion.</p>
<p>I have only to notice one other observation of Mr. Ross's, which
is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When I speak of strangers being admitted, it must not be
supposed that this was done by order of the House. No, everything
relating to the admission of strangers to, and their accommodation
in the House of Commons, is effected by some mysterious agency, for
which no one is directly responsible. Mr. Barry has built galleries
for strangers in the new house; but if the matter were made a
subject of inquiry, it probably would puzzle him to state under
what authority he has acted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not think there is anything mysterious as regards
admission. I am fond of hearing the debates, and my parliamentary
friends are very kind to me. Sometimes I content myself with an
order from a member, which takes me into the hinder seats of the
non-reporting strangers' gallery; sometimes, when I know beforehand
of an interesting debate, I get one of my friends to put my name on
the "Speaker's list," and I then take my seat on one of the two
front rows of the strangers' gallery; sometimes, again, I go down
on the chance, while the House is sitting; and if I am fortunate
enough to find any one of any friends there, he generally brings
me, in a few moments, an order from the Sergeant-at-arms, which
takes me also to the front row of the strangers' gallery. Some
benches under the strangers' gallery are reserved for peers,
ambassadors, and peers' eldest sons. The Speaker and the
Sergeant-at-arms give permission generally to foreigners, and
sometimes to some other persons, to sit in these benches. I do not
know which officer of the House of Commons superintends the
admission of reporters. Ladies are admitted to the Black Hole
assigned to them, by orders from the Sergeant-at-arms. I have no
doubt that the Speaker and Sergeant-at-arms are responsible to the
House for everything relating to the admission of strangers, and
without taking upon myself to say what is the authority under which
Mr. Barry has acted, I have no doubt that, in building galleries
for strangers in the new house, he has done what is consistent not
only with the long established practice, but, under the new order
of 1845, with the theory of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>As regards the passage quoted by Mr. Jackson from the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, the reviewer would probably allow that he
had overlooked the new standing order of 1845; and Mr. Jackson will
perceive that the recognition of the presence of strangers does not
legalise the publication of speeches. The supposed difficulty in
the way of legalising publication is, that the House of Commons
would then make itself morally responsible for the publication of
any libellous matter in speeches. I do not see the force of this
difficulty. But the expediency of the existing rule is not a proper
subject for discussion in your columns.</p>
<p class="author">CH.</p>
<p>Whatever the present practice of the House of Commons with
respect to strangers may be, it does not seem probable that it will
soon undergo alteration. In the session of 1849 a Select Committee,
composed of fifteen members, and including the leading men of all
parties, was appointed "to consider the present practice of this
House in respect of the exclusion of strangers." The following is
the Report of the Committee <i>in extenso</i> (<i>Parl. Pap.</i>,
No. 498. Sess. 1849):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That the existing usage of excluding strangers during a
division, and upon the notice by an individual Member that
strangers are present, has prevailed from a very early period of
parliamentary history; that the instances in which the power of an
individual Member to exclude has been exercised have been very
rare: and that it is the unanimous opinion of your committee, that
there is no sufficient ground for making any alteration in the
existing practice with regard to the admission or exclusion of
strangers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Report confirms the statement of Mr. Ross (p. 83.,
<i>ant&egrave;</i>), that within his experience of thirty-one years
no change has been made in the present rule of the House upon this
matter, which, it would seem, dates very far back. The Speaker was
the only witness examined before the Committee, and his evidence is
not printed.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>
<p><i>Morganatic Marriage</i> (Vol. ii., p. 72.).&mdash;According
to M., Ducange has connected this expression with <i>morgingab</i>;
but I have looked in vain for such connection in my edition of the
<i>Glossary</i> (Paris, 1733). The truth most probably is, that
<i>morganatic</i>, in the phrase "matrimonium ad morganaticam,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
"page126"></a>{126}</span> was akin to the Gothic <i>maurgjan</i>,
signifying, "to procrastinate," "to bring to an end," "to shorten,"
"to limit." This application of the word would naturally rise out
of the restrictions imposed upon the wife and children of a
morganatic marriage.</p>

women:</p>

<p>U.U. Club, July 2.</p>
<p><i>Bands</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 23. 76.)&mdash;<i>Scarf</i>.&mdash;I
was glad to read Arun's explanation of the origin of the bands now
worn by the clergy; which, however, seems merely to amount to their
being an adoption of a Genevan portion of clerical costume. That
they are the descendants of the ruff, there can be no doubt, just
as wrist-bands have more recently succeeded to ruffles.</p>
<p>I cannot resist mentioning that an ingenious friend suggested to
me, that the broad, stiff, laid-down collar, alluded to in the
former part of Arun's communication, possibly gave rise to the
modern band in the following manner:&mdash;When the scarf, still in
use, was drawn over the shoulders and hung down in front, that part
of the broad collar which was left visible, being divided up the
middle, presented a shape and appearance exactly like our common
bands. Hence, it was imagined, this small separate article of dress
might have originated.</p>
<p>Is it Butler, Swift, or who, that says,</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"A Chrysostom to smoothe his band in"?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Whenever this was written, it must have referred to our modern
bands.</p>
<p>Who amongst the clergy are <i>entitled</i> to wear a scarf? Is
it the badge of a chaplain only? or what circumstances justify its
being worn?</p>
<p class="author">Alfred Gatty.</p>
<p>July 1. 1850.</p>
<p><i>Bands</i> (Vol. ii., p. 76.).&mdash;An early example of the
collar, approaching to the form of our modern bands, may be seen in
the portrait of Cardinal Beatoun, who was assassinated in 1546. The
original is in Holyrood Palace, and an engraving in Mr. Lodge's
<i>Portraits</i>. The artist is unknown, but from the age of the
face one may infer that it was painted about 1540.</p>

<p><i>Jewish Music</i> (Vol. ii., p. 88.).&mdash;See a host of
authorities on the subject of Hebrew music and musical instruments
in Winer's <i>Realw&ouml;rterbuch</i> vol. ii., pp. 120.
<i>seq.</i>, 3d edit. There is a good abstract respecting them in
Jahn's <i>Hebrew Antiquities</i>, sect. 92-96.</p>
<p class="author">C.H.</p>
<p><i>North Sides of Churchyards unconsecrated</i> (Vol. ii., p.
55.).&mdash;In illustration of, not in answer to, Mr. Sansom's
inquiry, I beg to offer the following statement. During a long
series of years an average of about 150 corpses has been annually
deposited in Ecclesfield churchyard, which has rendered it an
extremely crowded cemetery. But, notwithstanding these frequent
interments, my late sexton told me that he remembered when there
was scarcely one grave to the north of the church, it being
popularly considered that only suicides, unbaptised persons, and
still-born children ought to be buried there. However, when a vicar
died about twenty-seven years ago, unlike his predecessors, who had
generally been buried in the chancel, he was laid in a tomb on the
north side of the churchyard, adjoining the vicarage. From this
time forward the situation lost all its evil reputation amongst the
richer inhabitants of the parish, who have almost entirely occupied
it with family vaults.</p>
<p>Whether the prejudice against the north side of our churchyard
arose from an idea that it was unconsecrated, I cannot tell but I
suspect that, from inherited dislike, the poor are still indisposed
towards it. When the women of the village have to come to the
vicarage after nightfall, they generally manage to bring a
companion, and hurry past the gloomy end of the north transept as
if they knew</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"that close behind</p>
<p>Some frightful fiend did tread."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I cannot help fancying that the objection is attributable to a
notion that evil spirits haunt the spot in which, possibly from
very early times, such interments took place as my sexton
described. As a suggestion towards a full solution of this popular
superstition, I would ask whether persons who formerly underwent
ecclesiastical excommunication were customarily buried on the north
side of churchyards?</p>
<p class="author">Alfred Gatty.</p>
<p>Ecclesfield, June 28. 1850.</p>
<p>I can only give from recollection a statement of a tradition,
that when Jesus Christ died he turned his head towards the south;
and so, ever since, the south side of a church has the
pre-eminence. There generally is the bishop's throne, and the south
aisle of ancient basilicas was appropriated to men. Simple
observation shows that the supposed sanctity extends to the
churchyard,&mdash;for there the tombstones lie thickest.</p>
<p>I find that my source of information for the <span class=
"pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> tradition

<p>The two of Mr. Hunter's <i>Critical and Historical Tracts</i>,

fullest the expectations we had formed of them. The first,
<i>Agincourt; a Contribution towards an authentic List of the
Commanders of the English Host, in King Henry the Fifth's
Expedition, in the Third Year of his Reign</i>, Mr. Hunter
describes as "an instalment," we venture to add "a very valuable
instalment," from evidence which has been buried for centuries in
the unknown masses of national records, towards a complete list of
the English Commanders who served with the King in that expedition,
with, in most cases, the number of the retinue which each Commander
undertook to bring into the field, and, in some instances, notices
of events happening to the contingents. The value of a work based
upon such materials, our historical readers will instantly
recognise. The lovers of our poetry will regard with equal
interest, and peruse with equal satisfaction, Mr. Hunter's brochure
entitled <i>Milton; a Sheaf of Gleanings after his Biographers and
Annotators</i>, and admit that he has bound up the new biographical
illustrations and critical comments, which he has gathered in that
pleasant field of literary inquiry, the life and writings of
Milton, into a goodly and a pleasant sheaf.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
